<p>For the last couple of years I was using Chrome, the main reasons were:</p><ul><li>Faster</li><li>Less memory</li><li>Better rendering (I used to complain a lot about <a href="http://ghostbar.co/2009/12/18/firefox-with-chrome-font-rendering-engine-no-way/">Firefox's text rendering</a>)</li></ul><p>But now, all those issues are long gone and there are bigger issues to face, and one of the biggest is: privacy.</p><p>The thing is, while Chrome is a modified and branded version of Google there's a huge issue with your privacy. Specially when they require you to be logged into your Google account to install some extensions and keep you logged "syncing" your data.</p><p>They know how to avoid extensions to be usable at certain URLs and they actually do it at their Chrome Store, so it just takes a pair of seconds to know they may disable your privacy enhancing extensions on their <code>*google.com</code> domains.</p><p>That kind of things makes me feel less safer using Chrome and a lot safer using Mozilla, a NGO that has shown their commitment for a free and open internet where user's rights are first.</p><p>I used to complain a lot about Firefox: slow, bloated, consuming all my memory, crashing randomly. Now it just works as it should and even better: <strong>makes me feel safe</strong>.</p>
