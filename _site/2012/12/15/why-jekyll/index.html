        <h2>Why?</h2>

<p><a href="http://ghostbar.ath.cx/2012/12/15/switched-to-jekyll/">I switched to Jekyll</a> but it wasn't a fast decision. I really tried to give WordPress a chance, again, but I'm not getting along pretty well with PHP since like 2 years ago. In fact, is a headache to maintain on my server. In the course of the years I have had several downtimes on my PHP-based sites because of changes like PHP-FPM. Some sites just dropped working for me while others kept doing OK. This is in the same server, with the same database and the same codebase (WordPress).</p>

<p>After a lot of time programming on Node.js and been learning more Ruby (<em>CoffeeScript made me love the syntax</em>) I just got tired of using more resources of what I really needed, and with a regular CMS that means a database. Why would I need a database if I just update like once a day? For a comment-system? There's Disqus already, and people can just comment you on Twitter or make a <a href="http://branch.com">Branch</a> for it, or just write you an email! Plain simple.</p>

<h2>Jekyll</h2>

<p>So there was Jekyll, a pretty nice tool creating static-sites very fast and easy to learn. It didn't needed a database and because all is static is pretty fast. Even the hosting requirements got lowered to the point I could (<a href="https://github.com/eserre/ghostbar.ath.cx">and I did</a>) just upload this to GitHub and served it from there as a GitHub Page!</p>

<h2>One more thing</h2>

<p>One thing made me decided to upload to GitHub as well was <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>, a simple text-editor for GitHub with support for MarkDown made by the guys @ <a href="http://developmentseed.com">developmentseed.com</a>. So while it was made for being updated on my terminal I could just do it as well from the web, from anywhere with just my GitHub account and having previews on-the-fly.</p>

<h2>The downside</h2>

<p>Since I don't control this server I couldn't setup redirections for my old feeds. Of course, I could have just copied the same pattern in a folder and put there an XML feeding the category X, but I think is easier to update the planets being feeded to the new URIs.</p>

<h2>On the bright-side</h2>

<p>I even could put pretty-permalinks to work! So the structure for my old links kept the same.</p>
