# My keys

I have 3 valid OpenPGP keys at the moment, one of those is going out of use in short-time, namely: [`1024D/0x38A0AD5BCACAB118`](/keys/0x38A0AD5BCACA118.pub.asc); it will expire one year after it goes out of the Debian Keyring (will update here the date as soon as I set it up).

The stronger `4096R/0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43` is my preferred key and will get into the Debian Keyring soon. You can grab a copy [here (https)](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43&op=vindex&fingerprint=on) or [here (non-https)](/keys/0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43.pub.asc).

The key [`4096R/0xFC23BA297C4DF50D`](/keys/0xFC23BA297C4DF50D.pub.asc) does belong to me as well but is not currently in use.
