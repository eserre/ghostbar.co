# My keys

I have 3 valid OpenPGP keys at the moment, but only one in use: The stronger `4096R/0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43` is my preferred key and it's in the Debian Developer's keyring. You can grab a copy [here (https)](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43&op=vindex&fingerprint=on) or [here (non-https)](/keys/0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43.pub.asc). Even grab one directly from Debian's LDAP with `finger ghostbar/key@db.debian.org`.

The weaker key [`1024D/0x38A0AD5BCACAB118`](/keys/0x38A0AD5BCACA118.pub.asc) was the one being used on Debian and now is out of use. It will expire on June 7th of 2015 and I do not have a copy on my daily-use machine so please: do not use it, use `0x13EC43EEB9AC8C43` instead.

The key [`4096R/0xFC23BA297C4DF50D`](/keys/0xFC23BA297C4DF50D.pub.asc) does belong to me as well but I do not use it.
