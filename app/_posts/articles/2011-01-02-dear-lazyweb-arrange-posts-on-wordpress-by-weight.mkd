I have searched all these days a WordPress plugin that let's me arrange my posts by weight or some kind of score system so I can do something like:
<pre>
query_posts('category_name='.$current_category.'&posts_per_page=1&min_weight=80&max_weight=100');
</pre>

Then only shows the last post with a weight between 80 and 100, and so on.

Any clue of any plugin that does anything at least similar?
