This is a remainder for me of what failed. While using <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch">stitch</a> module for Node.js together with NginX as proxy-reverse for my application I got 404 while trying to get /application.js, except anything else being generated at run-time.

The reason was the trailing slash in proxy_pass variable. So, instead of
<pre>
proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:88334/;
</pre>
You should use
<pre>
proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:88334;
</pre>

That fixed my issue, didn't had time to do further investigation, but that's a workaround for that issue.
