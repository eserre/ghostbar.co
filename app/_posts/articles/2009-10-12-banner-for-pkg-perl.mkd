I was just trying to get some banner so I could point from my blog to pkg-perl group on debian. I found the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianPerlGroup/LogoContest">LogoContest on debian wiki</a> but not the winner and since I didn't like any of them for a banner on my blog I decided to make a simple graphic of what I think should represent pkg-perl group on Debian. You can use them as you like:
