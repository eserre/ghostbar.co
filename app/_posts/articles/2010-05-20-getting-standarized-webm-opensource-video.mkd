<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>This are great news for us! All of us! Specially for people wishing to use all HTML5 features <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">ASAP</abbr> like <strong>me</strong>!  Today I read something that gave me even more hope, <a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2010/05/19/">Opera already launched some builds with WebM support</a> as well <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/webm/">as Firefox</a>. I'm wishing they build soon Opera Mini with WebM support so now I can fully use my mobile on all the websites, specially YouTube. Honestly I haven't seen Flash as a good thing. Even less now that there's HTML5, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/documents/30964170/Scribd-in-HTML5">see what Scribd has done</a>!</p>      <p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via web</a>   from <a href="http://joseluisrivas.posterous.com/getting-standarized-webm-opensource-video">joseluisrivas's posterous</a>  </p>  </div>
