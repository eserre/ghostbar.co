I was finding a solution to not use a bunch of <code>DIV</code>s with <code>PNG</code>s for shadows in some boxes, and found <code>box-shadow</code> that's supposed to be on CSS3 but checking the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/">CSS3 Background and Borders models</a> found that there's not anymore <code>box-shadow</code> so probably the solution will not be a standard soon.

Does anyone knows why?
