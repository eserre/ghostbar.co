Today I was remembering that, thinking on writing about it.

Frankly, I love that works because sometimes I don't understand what I did. A bunch of shell scripts, perl, cowbuilder, local apt-proxy and...

Maybe next time I feel like writing about my build system it will be trivial, not this time. Haha.
