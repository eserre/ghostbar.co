Two days ago I upgraded to the latest linux-image-2.6.32-5 on unstable and after rebooting my notebook it stopped working. First I saw on <code>dmesg</code> something related to <em>Microcode SW error</em>.

After a long search I just installed linux-image-2.6.37-rc5 from experimental and problem solved, so if you're passing trough the same issue and you are willing to use something it may not work perfectly in your case (but in mine it does) then that's a temporal solution :)

BTW, today Microcode SW error stopped showing up, but yesterday it showed that error even on the experimental-kernel.
