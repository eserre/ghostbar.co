I have been a long-time user of <code>approx</code>, I got used to it and knew how to configure it so all my machines + VMs used the same cache and saved me a lot of bandwidth.

But that was when I got a stable connection at >100KiB/s in a daily-basis. Now I'm with a mobile connection at <30KiB/s and sometimes is intermittent, so <code>approx</code> started giving me a lot of headaches.

When <code>approx</code> tries to connect a host that can't be resolved its domain name, then gets 404. How does that reflects in the <code>/pool</code>? Well, you get a file <code>touch</code>'d and 0 bytes size. When you try again, <code>approx</code> will find the same file with 0 bytes size and will gives you again a 404, even if you can now resolve the name address of that domain. And as I like to use what I know, then I made a workaround: Each time this happened I ran:

<blockquote><code># find /var/cache/approx -size 0 | xargs rm</code></blockquote>

So next time I requested a file to <code>approx</code> it tried to connect to the host. But I got tired.

I installed <code>apt-cacher-ng</code>, tweaked a bit <code>/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf</code> so it uses port 9999 and the cache dir redirects to the same cache than <code>approx</code> and done. <code>apt-cacher-ng</code> returns 503 when it can't connect to the peer, even tries to several repositories with only a line in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> in my clients. It makes me happy and keeps saving me a lot more of bandwidth than <code>approx</code>.
