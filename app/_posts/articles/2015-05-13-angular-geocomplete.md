So I was needing a resulting JSON array with possible solutions for a given address or city name and then [angular-geocomplete][nggeo] was made.

The great thing is that you can use it together with `typeahead` and now you have address/location autocomplete, just like the one on Google Maps.

And yes, it does uses Google Maps's API.

What's the advantage of this thing? You get coordinates together with all the names.

Installable via `bower` as well with `bower install angular-geocomplete`.

Any issue: to [the GitHub tracker](https://github.com/ghostbar/angular-geocomplete/issues).
