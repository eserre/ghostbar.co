I needed to resize about 300 images and couldn't find an easier way to do this than with help of node + CoffeeScript. So here's my script, it requires you to install (via npm) imagemagick and underscore:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2862235.js?file=resize.coffee"></script>

<a href="https://gist.github.com/2862235">Grab it</a> if you want, is under Do Whatever You Want license.

As you can see from the shebang (that's the first line of the script, with the #!) I ran it from my command-line, this was not used in a website, although it could without too much modifications (the magic of JavaScript).
