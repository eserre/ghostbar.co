I use Firefox and Chrome on parallel so must webs I visit on Chrome I do it as well on Firefox and today Google looks so SO different!

On Firefox the layout has blue buttons, the search layout is so different (and nice but), weird at the beginning but with so much logic after you use all the features. It has something with dates ranges that's very nice. It's better using Google on Firefox than Chrome now :-)

Here's screenshots on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ghostbar/4206878277/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ghostbar/4206878283/">Chrome</a>.
