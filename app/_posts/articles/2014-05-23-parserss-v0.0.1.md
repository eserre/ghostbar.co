I wrote `parserss` a few days ago, it's basically a wrapper for `feedparser` and it's convenient to have an easy to use JSON with all the data you require.

For more info just read the `README` at the [repository](https://github.com/ghostbar/parserss).

It's available from `npm` as well, just:

    npm install --save parserss

As soon as it have some tests it will be `v1.0.0`.
