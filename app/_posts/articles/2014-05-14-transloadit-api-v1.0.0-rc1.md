A release candidate for `v1.0.0` of `transloadit-api` is out.

You can install it via `npm` and give it a try.

    npm install transloadit-api@1.0.0-rc1

Now it supports the full [transloadit API](https://transloadit.com/docs/api-docs), together with signature's creation, assemblies, notifications and templates management.

The [source is on github](https://github.com/ghostbar/transloadit-api), the [docs are in this website](https://ghostbar.github.io/transloadit-api) as well as in the comments in the code (which is the source for the website) and of course, [any issue just report it on the github's tracker](https://github.com/ghostbar/transloadit-api/issues). It has a lot of tests but there are some tests missing, specially for operations that require internet.

Hopefully I will have time to write them this week and then release a proper `v1.0.0`.
