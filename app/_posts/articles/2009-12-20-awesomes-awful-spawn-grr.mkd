Yesterday I was trying to get some of my old keybindings (from awesome 2.x) to work on awesome 3.4 and it was awful the process.

With 2.x I worked with <code>awful.spawn</code> and got any bash command I wanted running. Now it changed to <code>awful.util.spawn</code> but if I wanted anything ran on a shell I had to use <code>awful.util.spawn_with_shell</code> but, at least for me, didn't worked. So I got commands like:
<pre>scrot ~/tmp/screenshots/$(date +%Y%m%d-%k%M%S).png</pre>

That one didn't ran directly. Nor my commands for volume management. So I got a workaround, used only <code>awful.util.spawn</code> calling scripts on my <code>~/bin</code> path. So if any of you has got issues with this just put your line on a bash script file, make it executable and use a line like:

<pre>awful.key({}, "Print", function () awful.util.spawn("scriptpath") end),</pre>

BTW, don't use <code>~</code> nor any thing needs a shell, use full paths to avoid confusion and bad functioning. I used <code>~/bin/d/anything</code> and didn't worked nor with <code>awful.util.spawn_with_shell</code>. I hope this help anyone with my same issues.
