I wrote a very simple `angular.js` directive for the [`zxcvbn` library](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).

You can give it a try with a live demo on [`plnkr`](http://plnkr.co/9wTZgR) and grab the code either from [github](https://github.com/ghostbar/angular-zxcvbn) or install it with:

    bower install angular-zxcvbn
